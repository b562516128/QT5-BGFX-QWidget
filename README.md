This is a C++ application. Use QT5.9(later versions should be OK) and BGFX. The view sample copy from the example-cubes.

2. add QT Tools to VS and config it
3. add these file to your QT project, and add includes and libs.
## Aboves are not necessary
1. the example is very easy, the three files (main.cpp, BGFXWidget.h/cpp ) contains all you need to know how to integrate QT with bgfx.
